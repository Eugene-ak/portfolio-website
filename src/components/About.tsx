        I am a hardworking individual passionate about the new technologies
        which keep popping out in our world. I'm currently a student at the
        University of Ghana studying Mathematical Science and majoring in
        Computer Science. I like to watch movies or code some projects during my
        leisure time. I also love learning new things and improving myself.
